//I learned that in JavaScript there are objects, in which you access data through properties. You can use strings or numbers as properties, but if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will typecast them as strings.
// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Broccoli",
  "legs": 6,
  "tails": 2,
  "friends": ["The fire hydrant on the corner", "Mrs. Tillerson's cat", "The UPS delivery driver"]


};
