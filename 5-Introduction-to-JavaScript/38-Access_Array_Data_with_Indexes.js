//I learned that you can access data within arrays by using indexes. They are also written in bracket notation but they are specifying an entry in an array. They also use zero-based indexing.
// Example
var ourArray = [50,60,70];
var ourData = ourArray[0]; // equals 50

// Setup
var myArray = [50,60,70];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[0]
