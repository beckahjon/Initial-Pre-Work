//A multi-dimensional array is essentially an array of arrays. The first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer most array, and each subsequent set of brackets refers to the next level of entries.
// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[2][1];
