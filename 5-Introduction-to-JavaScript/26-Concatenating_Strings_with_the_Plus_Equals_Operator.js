//It is possible to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string by using the += operator. This can help break up long strings.
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
