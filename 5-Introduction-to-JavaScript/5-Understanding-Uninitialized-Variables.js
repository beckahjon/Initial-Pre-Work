//When variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. You can't do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable. If you link a string with an undefined variable you will get a strong of undefined. If you initialize the variables they will not come up as undefined.
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
