//JavaScript uses zero-based indexing, which means it starts counting at zero, not one. You can use bracket notation to get a character at a specific index within a string.
// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
