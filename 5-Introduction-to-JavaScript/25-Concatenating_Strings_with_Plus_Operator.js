//To concatenate is to link things together. You can use the + operator with a string value to concatenate things together. You need to add your own spaces to concatenated strings.
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
