//A "do-while" loop will do one pass of the loop and then runs while a condition is true. It will stop when that condition is no longer true. A "do-while" loop ensures the code within the loop will run at least once.
// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.
do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 11)
