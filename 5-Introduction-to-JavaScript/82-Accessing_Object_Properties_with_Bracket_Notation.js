//Another way to access object properties is by using bracket notation. You must use bracket notation if there is a space in the property name (but you can still use it even if there's not). Property names with spaces in them must use quotation marks.
// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line

var entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];   // Change this line
var drinkValue = testObj["the drink"];    // Change this line
