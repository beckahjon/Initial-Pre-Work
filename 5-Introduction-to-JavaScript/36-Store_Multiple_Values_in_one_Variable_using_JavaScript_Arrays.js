//I learned you can store multiple pieces of data in one place by using an array variable. An array declaration begins and ends with a square bracket, and each entry inside is separated by a comma.
// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["Carrot cake", 42];
