//Capitalization matters in JavaScript, because all variables and function names are case sensitive. You can have multiple variables with the same name but different casing. It is best practice to use camelCase, in which the first word is all lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
